## QA Process

### Overview

The **QA process** for **BiponyShop** was designed to ensure the application meets high-quality standards. This included multiple stages of testing to identify bugs, verify functionality, and assess usability.

### Testing Phases

1. **Manual Testing**:

   * **Exploratory Testing**: The app was explored from an end-user perspective to identify any obvious bugs or usability issues.
   * **Functional Testing**: All core features like login, product search, cart functionality, checkout, etc., were manually tested to ensure they performed as expected.
   * **Regression Testing**: After each bug fix or feature implementation, regression tests were conducted to verify that no new issues were introduced.
   * **Usability Testing**: Feedback was gathered from users to evaluate the ease of use, intuitiveness of the interface, and overall user satisfaction.

2. **Automated Testing**:

   * **Unit Testing**: Python's `unittest` library was used to test individual functions for correct output.
   * **Integration Testing**: Flask’s test client was used to perform integration tests on API endpoints and check for correct responses.

3. **Performance Testing**:

   * **Load Testing**: Tools like Apache JMeter were used to simulate multiple users and check how the app performs under load.

4. **Cross-Browser Testing**:

   * The app was tested across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) to ensure compatibility.

### Skills Used

* **Manual Testing**: Exploratory, Functional, Usability, and Regression Testing.
* **Automated Testing**: Unit Testing, Integration Testing (Flask Test Client).
* **Bug Tracking**: Use of GitHub Issues to document, track, and resolve bugs.
* **Performance Testing**: Apache JMeter for load testing.
* **Version Control**: Git for source code management and collaboration.
* **Database Testing**: SQLite database queries were manually tested to ensure data consistency.

### Process Summary and Outcome

The QA process for **BiponyShop** involved identifying and fixing issues at various stages of development. A combination of **manual** and **automated** testing ensured that all key features functioned properly, usability was evaluated, and the system could handle a reasonable load. The outcome was a robust, high-performing web application that met the requirements set out at the beginning of the project.

### QA Directory

The **QA directory** contains all documentation related to the QA process, including:

* **Test Plan**: Outlining the scope, objectives, and methods for testing the application.
* **Test Cases**: Detailed descriptions of each test case, including the steps to execute and the expected outcomes.
* **Bug Reports**: Documenting the bugs found during testing, including the severity, steps to reproduce, and resolution status.
* **Test Reports**: Summarizing the overall results of the testing phase, including any issues found and fixed, and the application’s readiness for deployment.

### QA Directory Files
